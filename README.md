RightScale SSH extension for Google Chrome
==========================================

RightScale provides an SSH button for each server which launches a Java popup. This extension disables that and converts the link into a standard ssh:// protocol URL allowing you to open it with your default SSH/Terminal client.

The SSH URL will be in the form of `ssh://root@IP`. If you don't use `root` for your servers, this extension won't work without modifying the source.
